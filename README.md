# Individual-Project
&nbsp: Deep Q network active learning, train an RL agent using DQN to learn to select the most beneficial training samples from a given pool
&nbsp: Personalize the basic model by selecting a few (budget) data from the individual users



&nbsp;Tagger: the base learner (classifier), build with 
&nbsp;Game_ner is the environment for Reinforcement Learning
&nbsp;Robot is the DQN agent
&nbsp;Laucher is the main file to train Q-agent and get global model 
&nbsp;Healper contains the extra functions used, e.g. data loading, record saving
&nbsp:Test_model is the main file to personalize and test the performance of trained agent
&nbsp:Test_baselines is personalization with other Active Learning strategies
